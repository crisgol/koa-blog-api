- KCors
- Koa-Json-Error for JSON requests/responses
- Koa-Useragent to get client user-agent data
- Bcrypt
- Sendgrid for emails
- JWT
- Nodemon for running in development
- Babel
- PM2 for running in production
- MongoDB with Mongoose (mongoose validation)
- Seed data for testing app
- Password recover system with token

## Installing / Getting started
###Important! rename example.env to .env and enter your credentials also make sure you have mongoDB running.

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# Development with nodemon with hot reload
npm start

# build for production with prettier and babel
npm run build

# serve in production using the pm2 ecosystem.json file
npm run production

# run prettier on the project
npm run pretty

# run tests

## General Information

### User Authentication Process

User authentication process:

- User creates an account
- User verifies email
- User logs in
- The server sends and `accessToken`
- We take the `accessToken` and decode it using `jwt-decode`. This gets us the logged-in user's information`
- Each protected endpoint will be expecting you to attach the `accessToken` 

### PM2

Yep, PM2 is awesome on production.

The `src` folder is the heart of the program.

### Controllers

We use controllers to keep our router thin. 

The controller's responsibility is to manage the request body and make sure it's nice and clean when it eventually

gets sent to a `model` to make database calls.

### db

MongoDB with Mongoose for speed and fairly easy to used.

### middleware

The custom middleware we're using is based on the `koa-jwt` library.

### models

Our models folder where database calls are made and validation is performed

### routes

This is where we do authentication for restricted URL

### index.js

index.js it's the brain of the app.
